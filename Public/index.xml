      <description>I received my MSc in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London in 2016. Since then I have been working as a Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry. Before undertaking my Masters degree, I studied English Literature at the University of Sydney.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the course and shortly after finishing it, decided to pursue a career in statistics and data.</description>
