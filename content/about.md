I received my MSc in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London in 2016. Since then I have been working as a Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry. Before undertaking my Masters degree, I studied English Literature at the University of Sydney. During my second year of undergrad I took a course in introductory statistics. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the course and shortly after finishing it, decided to pursue a career in statistics and data.

My Interests are include building analytical tools in R and Python, Statstics, and Data Analysis. I am a proponent of the utility for data visualisation and bringing visual and interactive analytics to audiences that reach beyond the typical Statistician and Data Scientist circles.

I am also a keen cook and am always up for trying a new technique or recipe in the kitchen. However, I do seem to have this amazing talent in setting off the smoke alarm...
