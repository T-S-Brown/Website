I received my MSc in Medical Statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London in 2016. Since then I have been working as a Statistician in the pharmaceutical industry. Before undertaking my Masters degree, I studied English Literature at the University of Sydney. After taking an introductory statistics course in my second year of undergrad I was surprised how much I enjoyed the course. This resulted with myself making the decision to pursure a career in statistics.

### Other Interests

Outside of the stats life, I try to make the most of the outdoors. I enjoy running, hiking, cycling, and snowboarding. You will often find me running around Battersea Park or cycling in Richmond Park in London. I am also a keen cook and nothing really beats cooking in the evening with a beer in hand and a Spotify playlist going...until the smoke alarm goes off...
